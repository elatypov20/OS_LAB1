Prevention is very good strategy because it doesn't cause any overhead during the runtime and the only problem is that it can be too complex to make such structure

Recovery is as safe as prevention but it has extra overhead during the runtime, so it is good choice only if prevention is too hard or impossible to implement

Avoidance is applicable only when some extra information is available, so we can apply it to avoid deadlock. Not applicable in al cases, obviously.
